Battery Sweeper is a native macOS application designed to detect wireless Bluetooth devices and monitor their battery levels. This application focuses specifically on split keyboards since macOS only displays the battery level for one half of the device. Battery Sweeper provides visibility into the battery charge for each half of the keyboard separately, allowing for more effective battery management.

## Key Features

- **Bluetooth Device Discovery**: Quickly find all available wireless devices in your vicinity.
- **Battery Monitoring**: Get battery level information for each half of your split keyboard.
- **Support for Multiple Devices**: Theoretically, the app can monitor battery levels for other Bluetooth devices as well.
- **Lightweight**: The app takes up only 2 MB and consumes no more than 30 MB of RAM.
- **Built with SwiftUI**: Utilizing SwiftUI offers a fast and beautiful interface tailored for macOS.
- **Menu Bar Integration**: The application runs in the menu bar, providing easy access to its functions without needing to open additional windows.

## Installation
